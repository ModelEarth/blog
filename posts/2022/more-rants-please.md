[bad draft]

It's really hard to write an objective and unbiased article. This even seems to become harder the more you know about the topic, because you inevitably become more involved when you see more detail, you get more passionate and probably start seeing advantages and disadvantages of small opinions within the larger picture so you start picking sides.

I feel like this results in a problem: The people that are deeply knowledgable about topics tend to also be involved, so if they respect every side they won't really want to write an article for fear of it not being unbiased.

. or write opinion pieces (todo: whats the difference to a rant)

I love reading a great rant - both about topics I care about, even if my opinion differs from that of the author - as well as rants about topics I know nothing about, because it leads me to explore a world I have never thought about and didn't even know existed. Seeing people be passionate gives me energy.

-   grilled cheese rant
-   some linus torvalds rant
-   vegan fish sauce rant
-   ???

Do you know a good rant? Please send it to me, I'd love to read it and possibly add it to this list.
